  "solution": "[TOC]\n\n## Summary\nThis article is for beginners. It introduces the following ideas:\nQueue, Stack.\n\n## Solution\n\nQueue is **FIFO** (first in - first out) data structure, in which the elements are inserted from one side - `rear` and removed from the other - `front`.\nThe most intuitive way to implement it is with linked lists, but this article will introduce another approach  using stacks.\nStack is **LIFO** (last in - first out) data structure, in which elements are added and removed from the same end, called `top`.\nTo satisfy **FIFO** property of a queue we need to keep two stacks. They serve to reverse arrival order of the  elements and one of them store the queue elements in their final order.\n\n---\n\n### Approach #1 (Two Stacks) Push - $O(n)$ per operation, Pop - $O(1)$ per operation.\n\n#### Push\n\nA queue is FIFO (first-in-first-out) but a stack is LIFO (last-in-first-out). This means the newest element must be pushed to the bottom of the stack. To do so we first transfer all `s1` elements to auxiliary stack `s2`. Then the newly arrived element is pushed on top of `s2` and all its elements are popped and pushed to `s1`.\n\n![Push an element in queue](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksBPush.png){:width=\"539px\"}\n\n\n*Figure 1. Push an element in queue*#### Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time complexity : $O(n)$.\n\n Each element, with the exception of the newly arrived, is pushed and popped twice. The last inserted element is popped and pushed once. Therefore this gives  $4 n + 2$  operations where $n$ is the queue size. The  `push` and `pop` operations have $O(1)$ time complexity.\n\n* Space complexity : $O(n)$.\nWe need additional memory to store the queue elements\n\n#### Pop\n\nThe algorithm pops an element from  the stack `s1`, because `s1` stores always on its top the first inserted element in the queue.\nThe front element of the queue is kept as `front`.\n\n![Pop an element from queue](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksBPop.png){:width=\"539px\"}\n\n\n*Figure 2. Pop an element from queue*#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$.\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$.\n\n#### Empty\n\nStack `s1` contains all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` size to return if the queue is empty.#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$.\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$.\n\n#### Peek\n\nThe `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push or pop an element.#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$. The `front` element has been calculated in advance and only returned in `peek` operation.\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$.\n\n---\n\n### Approach #2 (Two Stacks) Push - $O(1)$ per operation, Pop - Amortized $O(1)$ per operation.\n\n\n#### Push\n\nThe newly arrived element is always added on top of stack `s1` and the first element is kept as `front` queue element\n\n![Push an element in queue](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksAPush.png){:width=\"539px\"}\n\n\n*Figure 3. Push an element in queue*#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$. Аppending an element to a stack is an O(1) operation.\n\n* Space complexity : $O(n)$. We need additional memory to store the queue elements\n\n#### Pop\n\nWe have to remove element in front of the queue. This is the first inserted element in the stack `s1` and it is positioned at the bottom of the stack because of stack's `LIFO (last in - first out)` policy. To remove the bottom element  from  `s1`, we have to pop all elements from `s1` and to push them on to an additional stack `s2`, which helps us to store the elements of `s1` in reversed order. This way  the bottom element of `s1` will be positioned on top of `s2` and we can simply pop it from stack `s2`. Once `s2` is empty, the algorithm transfer data from `s1` to `s2` again.\n\n![Pop an element from stack](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksAPop.png){:width=\"539px\"}\n\n\n*Figure 4. Pop an element from stack*#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity: Amortized $O(1)$, Worst-case $O(n)$. In the worst case scenario when stack `s2` is empty, the algorithm pops $n$ elements from stack s1 and pushes $n$ elements to `s2`, where $n$ is the queue size. This gives $2n$ operations, which is $O(n)$. But when stack `s2` is not empty the algorithm has $O(1)$ time complexity. So what does it mean by Amortized $O(1)$? Please see the next section on Amortized Analysis for more information.\n\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$.\n\n#### Amortized Analysis\n\nAmortized analysis gives the average performance (over time) of each operation in the worst case. The basic idea is that a worst case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time, thus amortizing its cost.\n\nConsider this example where we start with an empty queue with the following sequence of operations applied:\n\n$$\npush_1, push_2, \\ldots, push_n, pop_1,pop_2 \\ldots, pop_n\n$$\n\nThe worst case time complexity of a single pop operation is $O(n)$. Since we have $n$ pop operations, using the worst-case per operation analysis gives us a total of $O(n^2)$ time.\n\nHowever, in a sequence of operations the worst case does not occur often in each operation - some operations may be cheap, some may be expensive. Therefore, a traditional worst-case per operation analysis can give overly pessimistic bound. For example, in a dynamic array only some inserts take a linear time, though others - a constant time.\n\nIn the example above, the number of times pop operation can be called is limited by the number of push operations before it. Although a single pop operation could be expensive, it is expensive only once per `n` times (queue size), when `s2` is empty and there is a need for data transfer between `s1` and `s2`. Hence the total time complexity of the sequence is : `n` (for push operations) + `2*n` (for first pop operation) + `n - 1` ( for pop operations) which is $O(2*n)$.This gives $O(2n/2n)$ = $O(1)$ average time per operation.\n\n#### Empty\n\nBoth stacks `s1` and `s2` contain all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` and `s2` size to return if the queue is empty.#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$.\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$.\n\n\n#### Peek\n\nThe `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push an element. When `s2` is not empty, front element is positioned on the top of `s2`#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity : $O(1)$. The `front` element was either previously calculated or returned as a top element of stack `s2`. Therefore complexity is $O(1)$\n* Space complexity : $O(1)$."
